> In a stunning turn of events, third-party candidate Evelyn Green has caught fire and gained support above 40 percent, according to a new poll. This comes as the unpopularity of both major party candidates, [President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden](/posts/TrumpBiden.html), has reached record highs.

**Note: This is a fictional article. It is not meant to be taken seriously.  We asked a variety of sources who would be the best third-party candidate for the [2024 election](/posts/FearAndLoathing2024.html).  The results were surprising and Evelyn Green was the amalgamation of the clear winner.**

## Evelyn Green

Green is a former businesswoman and philanthropist with no prior political experience. She is running on a platform of [economic populism](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/05/tucker-carlsons-anti-corporate-views-00095426), social justice, and environmental protection. She has pledged to raise the minimum wage, expand access to healthcare, and invest in clean energy.

Green's rise has been fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the two major parties. Many voters feel that neither Trump nor Biden represents their interests. They are looking for an alternative, and Green has emerged as the most viable third-party candidate.

Green's candidacy has been met with mixed reactions from the political establishment. Some have praised her for her fresh ideas and her commitment to reform. Others have dismissed her as a [conspiracy theorist](https://wlog.app/posts/government-danger.html) and spoiler who could help [Trump or Biden](/posts/TrumpBiden.html) win.

## Political Momentum

However, Green's momentum is undeniable. She has been endorsed by a number of high-profile individuals, including celebrities, business leaders, and academics. She has also raised millions of dollars in campaign contributions and overcome a high profile [ransomware](https://wyr.world/posts/Ransomware.html) attack.

If Green's support continues to grow, she could become the first third-party candidate to win the presidency. This would be a major earthquake in American politics, and it would signal a profound dissatisfaction with the status quo.

##  Experts Weigh In

Political experts are divided on Green's chances of winning the presidency. Some believe that she has a real shot, while others say that it is too early to tell.

> "Evelyn Green is a serious candidate," said political analyst Larry Sabato. "She has a clear message, she is well-funded, and she is resonating with voters. If she can maintain her momentum, she could be a real force in this election."

However, other experts are more skeptical. "It is always difficult for a [third-party](https://wlog.app/posts/libertarian-party-has-failed.html) candidate to win the presidency," said political scientist John Sides. "There are a number of barriers that they have to overcome, such as the two-party system and the [Electoral College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1zmbVcMiEM). It is too early to tell if Green can break through those barriers."

Only time will tell if Green can make history and become the first third-party president in nearly three decades. But her rise is a sign that the American political landscape is changing.
