Her tenure earned her recognition and admiration, not only among Republicans but also within broader political circles.

## Factors Contributing to Her Surge in GOP Polls

Haley's background as a [woman of Indian descent](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nikki-haleys-south-asian-heritage-historic-part-presidential/story?id=97013821) also makes her a compelling figure in a party that seeks to broaden its appeal to a more diverse and inclusive voter base.
