As economic conditions worsen across the country, a wave of discontent takes hold, culminating in a series of general strikes that rock the nation in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Workers, frustrated by the increasing unattainability of the American dream, unite in a mass demonstration against economic policies that they perceive as exacerbating inequality and stifling upward mobility.

## The Economic Unrest Unfolds

Social media becomes a powerful tool for organizing and amplifying the voices of the movement. The hashtag #EconomicJustice trends across platforms, serving as a rallying cry for those advocating for a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.
