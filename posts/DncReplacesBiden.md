**2. Senator Elizabeth Warren:**
Known for her progressive policies and advocacy for economic reform, Senator [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/27/pocahontas-elizabeth-warrens-biggest-vulnerability-227912/) could be a unifying force within the Democratic base. Warren's track record on issues such as wealth inequality and consumer protection might resonate with voters seeking a bold vision for the country's future.

**3. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg:**
A rising star in the Democratic Party, Secretary of Transportation [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/infrastructure/biden-buttigieg-racial-equity-token-funding-fire-activists?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Pmax_USA_High-Intent-Audience-Signals) has garnered attention for his intelligence, poise, and fresh perspective. As a military veteran and the first openly gay cabinet member, Buttigieg could bring a unique appeal to a broad spectrum of voters.

**4. Governor [Michelle Lujan Grisham](https://news.yahoo.com/mexico-gov-michelle-lujan-grishams-183031293.html):**
